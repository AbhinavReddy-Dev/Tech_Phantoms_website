This is the source code for tech_phantoms website
So @imabp and I decided to build the website completely from scratch again as we are changing the design completely. As we will have to prepare for **Hacktoberfest**, I think we should aim in completing the website completely within September itself. 

In the mean time, we will be having 

We have a very talented and diverse team, mastering in different fields, but still working in a team and collaborating is tougher than it looks. So for this, we will be using GitHub and Zenhub to manage our complete development process. Our hole development will be divided into several sprints, which will be a week of long. All features will be organized as epics and under them, we will have issues that will be taken by members for them to solve. This way we will be able to check on the progress, and also see that no two people are doing the same thing. 

## TODO
- [ ] Create All the pages
	- [ ] Landing Page
	- [ ] Team Page
	- [ ] Projects Page
	- [ ] Events Page
	- [ ] Hacktoberfest 

> The designers will not design the whole page completely, rather design small components and dev team can code that up and keep on conecting the components accordingly
